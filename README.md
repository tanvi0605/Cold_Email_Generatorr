Example Use Case:
Consider a scenario where Nike is hiring a Principal Software Engineer. Our tool enables a business development executive (e.g., Mohan from Atliq) to reach out with a targeted email, offering Nike a pre-vetted software engineer who meets their needsâ€”saving Nike time and resources in recruitment and onboarding.
